# phish-me-not

## Project Description
Phish-me-not is a browser extension designed to protect users from phishing attacks by blocking access to known phishing websites. The extension identifies and blocks malicious websites, preventing users from falling victim to phishing scams.

## Features
- Blocks access to known phishing websites
- Displays a warning page when a phishing attempt is detected
- Alerts users when they click on phishing links
- Redirects users to a safe page when a phishing site is detected

## How It Works
The extension uses a predefined list of known phishing websites and blocks access to these sites by redirecting the user to a warning page. When a user clicks on a phishing link, the extension alerts the user and prevents the link from being opened.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itsmeneil23/phish-me-not.git
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` for Chrome).
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder.

## Usage
Once the extension is installed, it will automatically start protecting you from phishing attacks. If you try to visit a known phishing site, you will be redirected to a warning page. If you click on a phishing link, you will receive an alert.
